# Lupaxa CertTool

`lupaxa-certtool` is a small, security-focused utility for generating **self-signed X.509 certificates**,
**certificate signing requests (CSRs)**, and **private keys** from either:

- Command-line options (DN + config), or
- One or more JSON configuration files.

It is designed for:

- Local development
- Labs, demos and PoCs
- Quickly bootstrapping TLS for services like Apache, Nginx, or internal tools

## Project Version

Current version: `0.1.1`

## Features

- CLI and Python API
- JSON-based configuration (single file or directory of files)
- Optional output directory with per-certificate subdirectories
- RSA key generation (configurable key size)
- Self-signed certificates with configurable validity
- SAN (Subject Alternative Name) support via JSON
- Built-in `--validate-config` to check JSON configs
- `--inspect-cert` to inspect existing PEM certificates
- Fully tested with `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy`

## Security Warning — Do Not Use These Certificates in Production

The certificates generated by this tool are self-signed and are intended only for development, testing, internal tooling, and
non-security-critical environments. Self-signed certificates do not provide real trust, cannot be validated by clients, and offer
no protection against man-in-the-middle attacks in production systems.

In secure deployments, always:

- Use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)<br />
  (public CA for internet-facing systems, or a properly managed private CA within your organisation).
- Protect private keys with strict file permissions and rotate them regularly.
- Avoid re-using development certificates or keys on production hosts.
- Validate certificate chains, expiration dates, key sizes, and signature algorithms as part of your CI/CD or deployment process.
- Ensure that TLS configurations follow modern hardening guidance (e.g., current Mozilla or OWASP recommendations).

Self-signed certificates are useful for local testing, CI pipelines, and ephemeral environments — but they provide no assurance of identity
or trustworthiness in real-world security scenarios.
